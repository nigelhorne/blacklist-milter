Before installing check the routine isWhiteList, and the table localNets both
of which are contained in blacklist-milter.c

To install, compile the program.  On Debian Linux I used

	apt-get install libmilter-dev
	cc $CFLAGS blacklist-milter.c -lmilter -lpthread -L/usr/lib/libmilter
	mv a.out /usr/local/etc/blacklist

Add a line such as these to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc 

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`blacklist', `S=local:/var/run/blacklist, F=T, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM',`i')dnl

Then:
	cd /etc/mail && make

If you're using systemd, add this as
/etc/systemd/system/blacklist-milter.service:

	[Unit]
	Description=Blacklist e-mailers
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	ExecStart=/usr/local/etc/blacklist local:/var/run/blacklist
	KillMode=process
	Restart=on-failure

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then run
	systemctl daemon-reload
	systemctl enable blacklist-milter.service
	systemctl start blacklist-milter.service

If you're not using systemd, Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local:

	rm -f /var/run/blacklist
	/usr/local/etc/blacklist local:/var/run/blacklist

Then run
	/usr/local/etc/blacklist local:/var/run/blacklist

Finally reload sendmail:
	/etc/init.d/sendmail reload
