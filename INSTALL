Before installing check the routine isWhiteList, and the table localNets both
of which are contained in blacklist-milter.c

To install, compile the program.  On Debian Linux I used

	cc $CFLAGS blacklist-milter.c -lmilter -lpthread -L/usr/lib/libmilter
	mv a.out /usr/local/etc/blacklist

Add a line such as this to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc 

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`blacklist', `S=local:/var/run/blacklist, F=T, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl

Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local:

	rm -f /var/run/blacklist
	/usr/local/etc/blacklist local:/var/run/blacklist

Start the milter:
	/usr/local/etc/blacklist local:/var/run/blacklist

Then reload sendmail:
	/etc/init.d/sendmail reload
