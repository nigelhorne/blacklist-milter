blacklist-milter
================

Blacklist-milter is a milter (i.e. a sendmail filter/plug-in) which
blocks connections from remote sites that are spamming us by raising
the firewall.
The remote sites are blocked for a configurable amount of time.

NB: Contrary to all the advice everywhere, this milter needs to run
as root so that it can modify your firewall.  If you don't like that,
then don't use blacklist-milter.  Sorry.
